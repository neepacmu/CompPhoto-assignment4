# Q1: 

``` python q1.py ```

The above command would perform the following:

1. Create lightfield
2. Plot lightfields
3. Calculate depth images at different depths from the focal stack
4. Form all-in-focus image and depth from focus by setting sigma_1 and sigma_2 
5. Build a focal aperture stack and perform confocal stereo

# Q2: 

``` python q2.py ```

The above command runs a python file that reads image files created from a video and performs refocusing on specific objects using template matching

# Utils
